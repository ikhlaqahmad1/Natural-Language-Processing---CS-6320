## Semester project - Machine-generated Text Detector

### About the Project


####  With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, there is a growing need to differentiate
#### between AI-generated and human-generated content, particularly in areas such as online 
#### content moderation, plagiarism detection, and news verification.
#### The purpose of this project is to encourage original work and academic integrity 
#### using machine learning techniques to detect if a piece of text has been
#### generated by human or artificial intelligence.</p>


## Technical Detail(s)
#### 1. This program is primarily written in Python with user experience interface using html
#### 2. The dataset has been taken from Kaggle.com/AI_Human.csv which contains about half
#### a million essays, pre-labeled for human (0) or AI (1)
#### 3. The model is trained using machine learning technique ***Convolutional Neural Networks***
#### 4. The model was trained for a total of epochs due to time and computing power constraints.

### Technologies/Dependencies:
#### 1. Python v3.11
#### 2. HTML5

### Libraries:
#### 1. Pandas - For data processing
#### 2. Keras - For neural network models
#### 3. Tensorflow - For machine learning Model
#### 4. sklearn - For numerical analysis
#### 5. Flask - For web and user interface
#### 6. For complete list - requirements.txt

### To Run:
#### 1. Run app.py and it will give an http://127.0.0.1:5000 address where 5000 is a port number.
#### 2. After a few runs, the port 5000 may need to be freed or a different port must be assigned
#### for local hosting.
